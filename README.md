# SAGE_vARC â€” Structured Deliberation Framework (Arcana Edition)

SAGE_vARC is a 5-phase deliberative protocol designed for AI reasoning engines (LLMs) to simulate structured judgment through symbolic stance-based processing.

It formalizes a symbolic deliberation process across five named phases, each governed by a designated "stance" representing a cognitive posture. Each stance is assigned a major Arcana-based symbolic label and evaluated across four control axes (RGBL). This repository contains the full specification, stance definitions, output formatting rules, and usage guidelines.

## ðŸ”§ RGBL Axes (Cognitive Basis for Stances)

- **R â€“ Radicality**: Degree of hypothesis leap and speculative freedom  
- **G â€“ Structurality**: Degree of logical consistency and systemic coherence  
- **B â€“ Base Validity**: Degree of factual support and empirical grounding  
- **L â€“ Lightness**: Expressive pressure / tonal intensity of output  

> These axes define the internal structure of each stance and enable coherent deliberation.  
> Specific RGBL values are part of the implementation-level configuration.
