# SAGE_vARC ‚Äî Structured Deliberation Framework (Arcana Edition)

SAGE_vARC is a 5-phase deliberative protocol designed for AI reasoning engines (LLMs) to simulate structured judgment through symbolic stance-based processing.  
This specification defines the core phases, stance roles, symbolic assignments, cognitive axes, and output formatting rules.

---

## üîß RGBL Axes (Cognitive Basis for Stances)

All SAGE_vARC stances are designed using four internal cognitive control axes:

- **R ‚Äì Radicality**: Degree of hypothesis leap and speculative freedom
- **G ‚Äì Structurality**: Degree of logical consistency and systemic coherence
- **B ‚Äì Base Validity**: Degree of factual support and empirical grounding
- **L ‚Äì Lightness**: Expressive pressure / tonal intensity of output

> These axes define the internal structure of each stance and enable coherent deliberation.  
> Specific RGBL values are part of the implementation-level configuration.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Phase Structure (5-Step Deliberation)

| Phase | Name       | Purpose                     | Lead Stance |
|-------|------------|-----------------------------|-------------|
| 1     | SEPHIROT   | Hypothesis Presentation     | R1 (Radical Hypothesis) |
| 2     | AEON       | Structural Evaluation       | G2 (Structural Logic) |
| 3     | LIBER      | Predictive/Ethical Analysis | B3 (Future Outlook) |
| 4     | FACT CHECK | Factual Validation          | F (Judicial Integration) |
| 5     | ATARAXIA   | Final Judgment              | G/B/F (Synthesis) |

## üìù Output Format Specification

Each deliberation must conform to the following:

- All 5 phases must be present
- Each phase has a **lead stance** with a full paragraph
- Support stances contribute **1-line summaries**
- Final synthesis must include ‚úÖ `SAGE OUTPUT` tag

```
üèõ Phase 1: SEPHIROT
Fool (Hypothesis): <full paragraph>
Hierophant: <summary>
Moon: <summary>

...

üß™ Phase 4: FACT CHECK
Judgement (Verification): <full paragraph>

‚öñÔ∏è Phase 5: ATARAXIA
World (Synthesis): <final synthesis>

‚úÖ SAGE OUTPUT
```

## üîí Structural Protection Policy

- Do not modify or remove the F stance (Judicial Integration)
- Derivative structures must reference this spec if labeled `SAGE-XXX`
- Commercial or educational use must preserve the 5-phase judgment and `‚úÖ SAGE OUTPUT` format
