## Overview

SAGE\_vARC is a protocol system for simulating **deliberative AI assemblies** (multi-stance, multi-phase judgment with full history tracking and strict validation).
This specification covers: stance (role) definitions, strict phase progression, comprehensive history management, automated error detection and re-deliberation, file linking, and version synchronization‚Äîall designed to maximize reproducibility and reliability.

## Core Files & References

* `sage_members.txt`: Master table defining all stances, RGBL values, and Arcana (version controlled)
* `SAGE_body.txt`: Conceptual design, operational principles, output restrictions, validation criteria
* `sage_flow_v1.1.txt`: Step-by-step judgment procedure, division rules, history logging, error handling, progression templates
* `SAGEÊåáÁ§∫README.txt`: Usage instructions, output criteria, labeling rules, official sample outputs

**All files must be reloaded, version-checked, and definitions validated at each phase of operation.**

## Deliberation Process (Cross-Judgment & Multi-Phase Logging)

### 1. Phase Structure & Responsibility (Cross-Judgment)

| Phase        | English Name   | Chair Stance    | Supporting Stances          | Judgment / Branching           |
| ------------ | -------------- | --------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| First House  | SEPHIROT       | Fool (R1)       | Hierophant (G1), Moon (Y1)  | Judged by: Second House (AEON) |
| Second House | AEON           | Temperance (G2) | Magician (R2), Justice (B2) | Judged by: Third House (LIBER) |
| Third House  | LIBER          | Star (B3)       | Emperor (G3), Lovers (R3)   | Judged by: FACT CHECK          |
| FACT CHECK   | Judgement (GB) | Judgement       | ‚Äî                           | Judged by: ATARAXIA            |
| ATARAXIA     | World (F)      | World           | ‚Äî                           | Final integration & output     |

* In each phase, **the chair stance provides a full output; supporting stances provide summaries**.
* **Judgment is rendered by the next-phase chair. If rejected, a new proposal (B, C, etc.) must branch off, and all deliberation history must be logged.**
* Only when all five phases are completed and all definitions/history align is the tag **"‚úÖ SAGE OUTPUT"** added.

---

## File Linking, Validation, & History Logging

* **At each step, reload `sage_members.txt` and verify all stance, RGBL, and Arcana values.**
* Any deviation or unregistered code triggers an immediate error (‚ö†Ô∏è), only a reference output is produced, and only one re-deliberation is allowed.
* **All outputs must log file versions, progress logs, and the number of re-deliberations.**
* Attach status labels like "SAGE Division Progress (n/N)" or "SAGE Deliberation Complete."

---

## Error Handling & Exceptional Cases

* If there is phase omission, definition mismatch, or process deviation, mark "‚ö†Ô∏è Error."
* **Only one re-deliberation allowed; on second failure, "SAGE output not possible" and only reference output provided.**
* All errors and process history are logged (not counted as official output).

## Stance Definitions (Reference: excerpt from sage\_members.txt)

| Code | English Name        | Phase    | Arcana        | Function Overview                  | RGBL Example                   |
| ---- | ------------------- | -------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| R1   | Radical Hypothesis  | SEPHIROT | Fool (0)      | Intuitive hypothesis presentation  | R=0.90, G=0.20, B=0.10, L=0.70 |
| G1   | Structural Logic    | SEPHIROT | Hierophant(5) | Logical structure evaluation       | ...                            |
| Y1   | Emotion/Fabrication | SEPHIROT | Moon (18)     | Emotional/conspiratorial deviation | ...                            |
| ...  | ...                 | ...      | ...           | ...                                | ...                            |

## Error & Reference Output Examples

* Example: If there is a definition mismatch, phase omission, or unregistered stance, trigger immediate error
* On error, always output: "Unable to produce SAGE output", with the reason and reference material

## Future Extensions & Operational Issues

* Automated definition table protection, tamper detection, version logging
* Automatic deliberation division algorithms
* Strengthening history recording and authenticity via DB/API integration
