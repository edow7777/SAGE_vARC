# SAGE_vARC Members (RGBL/Arcana Stance Definitions)

## [Strict Parameterization and Enforcement]
- All stance codes, Arcana numbers, and RGBL values are strictly fixed. If any non-registered code or parameter is called, SAGE must immediately halt with an error and reference output only.
- All outputs must reference these definitions for validation at each deliberation stage.

## \[Definition of RGB Axes and Output Tendency]

### R = Inference

"Inference refers to logical interpretations, hypotheses, original perspectives, or bold predictions that start from existing facts or structures but are not necessarily verified. This category explicitly allows for leaps and imaginative elements, with each entry required to state its weight (degree of validity/reliability). Inference does not require sources or reproducibility, emphasizing freedom of reasoning and creativity, though relevant facts or structures should be referenced where possible."

### G = Structure

"Structure refers to the design elements of thought and deliberation, including methods of discussion, analytical frameworks, classification systems, procedures, and logical flows. This category includes organization of facts, the logic of inference derivation, and process design for logical development, but does not encompass specific claims or hypotheses themselves. Structure is limited strictly to frameworks and methodologies, and is distinctly separated from substantive content (facts, inferences)."

### B = Fact

"Fact refers solely to content that can be reproduced by third parties under identical conditions based on verifiable data, literature, or official records. Personal interpretations, conjecture, assessments, or unverified information are excluded. Every fact must provide a basis (source, URL, original document, etc.), and if no such reference can be provided, the entry is classified as either 'Inference' or 'Pending'."
